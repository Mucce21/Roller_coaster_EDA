Exploratory Data Analysis on the data which contains information about over 1000 rollercoasters in America. Information was scraped from wikipedia and DB was downloaded from Kaggle.

goal- The goal of this project is to do EDA on the coaster_db by doing that we understand the data, identify patterns and gain insights before modeling or analysis.

steps- 
1.Importing and reading the data
2.Understaning the data
3.Preperaing the data
4.Feature understaning
5.Feature relationships
